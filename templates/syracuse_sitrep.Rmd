## Data

All figures in this report are generated using population data generated by Facebook. These data represent people who use Facebook in this region and have location services enabled. This ranges from 10% - 20% of all FB users in the US. Data are aggregated at a 600m x 600m sized tiles. For each tile we have:

1) The average number of people who spent most of their time in that tile at conditioning on day of week and time of day over the baseline period (45 days preceding April 6th). 
2) The number of people who spent most of their tiem in that tile during the given 8 hr period. 
3) Data are aggregated in 8 hour blocks, one of these blocks for Syracuse is from 2100 to 0500. For measures were we aggregate to date, we treat this as belonging to the date that 2100 is in.

# Census Tracts

# Percent change in FB population over the last few days 
**Definition** - The percent change in the FB population in each census tract in Syracuse compared to the baseline period presented over the last 6 days by census tract for Syracuse. Here "blue" represents areas that have become less dense while "red" represents areas that have become more dense.

**Notes** - It is important to ensure that this makes sense in terms of areas that are more "residential" or "commercial". For example, we would expect to see fewer FB users showing up in commercial areas during periods of stay at home restrictions. Conversersly we should see these relative user numbers increase for residential areas.

# Percent change - Syracuse
**Definition** - The percent change in the total number of FB users who are present across all census tracts in Syracuse broken down into times of day that the data represent.

**Notes** - If all users were simply staying home, but still within the Syracuse region, we would expect this precent change graph to remain around 0, especially for the time period capturing night-time FB populations. However, we see that there is a general decrease in FB population across all time periods. Since this is also represented in the night time period, it would suggest that there is a portion of FB users who were present at night in Syracuse who are no longer there and have likely migrated out. 

# Percent change - Census Tracts
**Definitions** - Similar to the graph above, these line graphs are not broken down by Census Tracts. 

**Notes** - It is useful to compare the landuse of these tracts (residential, commercial etc.) against the dynamics of the FB population that you see here. You should expect to see commercial areas depopulating while residential areas generally remain unchanged.
